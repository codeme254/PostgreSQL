# Operators
We can use operators to check if values specify a certain condition.

PostgreSQL returns ```t``` to mean true and ```f``` to mean false.

## Equal to (=)
Used to check if one value is equal to another.

## Less than (<)
Checks if one value is less than another.

![less than](less than.png)

## Less than or equal to (<=)
Checks if a value is either less than or equal to another value.

## greater than (>)
Checks if one value is greater than the other.

## greater than or equal to (>=)
Checks if one value is either greater than or equal to another.

## not equal to (<>)
Checks if a value is not equal to another. We can also use ```!=```.

## Logical AND
Used when you want to check for more than one condition.

Returns true if all the conditions are true.

## Logical OR
It is also used to check for multiple conditions.

Returns true if at least one of the conditions is true.

## IN operator
Used to check if a value exists in a specified array of values.

## BETWEEN
Checks if a value falls within the specified ranges.

AND operator is used to specify these ranges.

## NOT
Used to reverse the truthiness, ie, reverses true to false and vice versa.
