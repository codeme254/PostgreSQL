# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a relational Database Management System.

PostgreSQL is an open-source, object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) known for its robustness, scalability, and adherence to SQL standards.

In a Relational Database Management System, data is stored in tables (also called relations), where each table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields).

The core feature of an RDBMS is its use of SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing the database.

Other examples of RDMS are: MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL), SQLite.
